We collected, processed, and analyzed Twitter text data to measure various aspects of public sentiment towards nuclear energy in the United States. This project contains: 

(a) data acquisition and preprocessing of over 50,000 tweets 

(b) user inference using a multi-modal deep learning model 

(c) topic analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 

(d) natural language processing (NLP) sentiment classification using state-of-the-art deep learning models

(e) efficient frequent pattern mining using FP-Growth 


Paper Abstract: 

The public debate over nuclear energy has been smoldering in the United States for many decades. In recent years, increasing concerns over climate change and the reliability of renewable energy sources have elevated the profile of nuclear energy as a zero-emissions energy source. This paper seeks to analyze the public discourse around nuclear energy on the social media platform, Twitter. With our analysis, we have obtained not only similar results to those published in survey analyses but also key insights that are not represented in the published survey data. We find that 67 percent of users in our dataset primarily expressed positive sentiments towards
nuclear energy, and more interestingly, that men and older people express more positive sentiments than women and younger people, respectively. Additionally, the key concerns regarding nuclear energy are nuclear waste, accidents, and nuclear weapon proliferation. Accounts belonging to organizations are the predominant advocates of nuclear energy as a potential aid in addressing climate change, while accounts belonging to individuals, particularly women and young people, tweeted more about the threats posed by nuclear weapons and accidents. Ultimately, the broadly positive sentiments expressed in our dataset bode well for the future of nuclear energy in the United States.
